# 🎬 Capstone: Movie Review Sentiment Analyzer (MLOps Project)

This project demonstrates a **Movie Review Sentiment Analyzer** built with a strong focus on **MLOps best practices**. The core goal is to serve an ML model in production using tools like **MLflow**, **DVC**, and **FastAPI**.

> While the machine learning model is relatively simple (a binary text sentiment classifier), the project’s focus is on building a robust, maintainable, and reproducible MLOps pipeline.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Text Sentiment Prediction** – Classifies movie reviews as **Positive** or **Negative**
- 📊 **MLflow** – For experiment tracking, model versioning, and deployment
- 📦 **DVC (Data Version Control)** – For managing and versioning data and model artifacts
- 🌐 **FastAPI** – For exposing the trained model as a REST API
- ☁️ **S3 Integration** – For storing datasets and model artifacts in the cloud
- 🧪 **Modular Codebase** – Clean structure for preprocessing, training, evaluation, and serving
